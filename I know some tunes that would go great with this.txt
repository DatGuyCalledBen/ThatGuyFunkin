                   Adding Your Own Music
==============================================================

Integrating your custom music into ThatGuyFunkin is straightforward. Follow these steps to enhance your gaming experience:

MP3 Integration
----------------
1. File Placement: Place your MP3 file in the /ThatGuyFunkin/ base folder.
2. Specification: Specify the track in the index.html file. The engine will seamlessly detect and integrate your music without any additional configuration.

Lipsyncing with JSON Files
---------------------------
Lipsyncing involves a more detailed process, offering opportunities for innovation within the field:

- JSON Format: Utilize a .json file structured similarly to ninjamuffin99's Friday Night Funkin (FNF) data style. This file includes notes represented as an array with specific information (direction, time, duration).

- Charting: While traditional manual charting involves coding each entry within a code editor, ThatGuyFunkin supports a simplified approach. Directly copy the data array into a standalone format enclosed in square brackets ([ [entry1], [entry2], [entry3] ]).

MIDI Conversion and Character Movements
----------------------------------------
To synchronize character movements with music tones, convert your MP3 to MIDI format using any MP3 to MIDI converter. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- Mapping Tones to Movements: Each MIDI note number (ranging from 0 to 127) corresponds to a specific character movement:
  - Example: MIDI Note 60 (C4) correlates with character movement UP.

- Implementation: Implement a mapping system where MIDI note numbers are converted into character movements based on their remainder when divided by 12. This method ensures accurate synchronization across different octaves.

Generating JSON Files
----------------------
Automate the creation of .json files using a Python script or similar tool. This script processes the MIDI data, converting it into a parsable .json format suitable for charting use.

Implementation Steps
---------------------
1. Convert to MIDI: Use an MP3 to MIDI converter to generate a MIDI file.
2. Python Script: Develop or adapt a Python script to convert MIDI data into a .json file.
3. Specify JSON File: Once generated, specify the .json file within the program configuration.
4. Integration: Upload the .json file and launch ThatGuyFunkin to see your custom music integrated seamlessly into the gameplay environment.

This approach empowers developers to innovate in creating intricate, synchronized worlds around their characters using dynamic 3D modeling environments within ThatGuyFunkin.
